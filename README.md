# SECURE SATELLITE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM — ENCRYPTION & PACKET SIMULATION

o	Built a full simulation of secure communication between satellites using both AES (symmetric) and RSA (asymmetric) encryption.

o	Used AES to encrypt the message content and RSA to securely exchange the AES key, combining both into a hybrid encryption system.

o	Designed CCSDS-style packets, including metadata like timestamps and sequence numbers, to follow real satellite communication standards.

o	Visualized the full message flow using Matplotlib—from message creation, encryption, sending, decryption, to final reading.

o	Simulated real-world communication delays between satellites by adding time steps and measuring each phase in the process.

o	Gained practical experience in encryption, data structuring, and visualizing secure protocols in a space systems context.
